# The-Simon-Game

This is a very popular memory game in which the player has to remember the sequence of the colours that has flashed and select the colours in the same sequence or the player fails the level.

This game is made using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I have used the popular JS library called JQuery.

This is my first Project wherein I have used callback functions extensively along with other pre-defined functions. Animations have been added to make the game for lively.

I will be updating the game to make it more lively and fun to play. Different animations, new images rather than colours will be added with an attractive background.
